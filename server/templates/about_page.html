        <strong>
          Flow is a social course planning website.
        </strong>
        Launched in September 2012, it was built by four students in Software
        Engineering at the University of Waterloo. What does the name mean?
        Well, we're not sure ourselves... we launched with it, and it just sort
        of stuck!

        Ayush can often be found on the bike exploring the great outdoors, in a 
        cafe with his nose in a book, or pacing excitedly while listening to a debate.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is currently enjoying the excellent weather that Vancouver has to 
        offer while working on online services for Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 at Demonware.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun fact: he has eaten Alligator, and he contends that (while they may look very

        Bob currently resides in the city of Toronto, busy enjoying the freezing temperatures of the 
        Canadian winter. He is very excited about his ongoing machine learning research at SideFX Software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bob is not much of a web development guy, but he values the services that Flow provides both in his
        own life as a student and in the greater UWaterloo community. On the side, he loves a challenging workout 
        and he's always down for some pickup. Anytime, anywhere.

        Dmytro likes precisely those things which are meticulously studied and well-understood. For that reason, he doubts he will be a very good researcher.

        There was a time where doing web development was near the bottom of Max's interests and fiddling 
        with UI unthinkable. But alas here he is doing web development and working on Flow's UI. Unless he gets sidetracked by Game of Thrones, of course.
