    Hope exams are going well.

    Just a reminder, you can win a $50 gift card, Kindle, or potentially a Nexus 7 by reviewing courses and profs on Flow! You'll need 300 points to qualify, and each point is another chance to win. Check your profile at http://uwflow.com/profile/%(user_id)s?points=1 to see your current points.

    There's only 2 days left until the contest ends this Wednesday, 12/12/12 at 12:12:12 pm. So take a quick study break by reviewing some courses on http://uwflow.com.

    Good luck with exams!
