    UW Flow is going to be pitching at VeloCity's Demo Day:

    http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/velocity-demo-day/finals-velocity-demo-day

    today in the DC foyer from 12 - 1 pm! We'd love to meet you at our booth from 1 - 3 pm!

    In a few days, we'll be starting a contest to reward you for using Flow and just being awesome.

    Come by our booth today and get a head start by telling us what you think of Flow. You're the reason we're doing this, so we'd love to meet you in person and hear your feedback!

    See you there!
