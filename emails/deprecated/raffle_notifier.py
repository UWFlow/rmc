    We're running a contest rewarding you for using Flow! In two 2 weeks, we'll be raffling off a $50 food gift card, Kindle, and Nexus 7 depending on the total points earned by everyone. The more points everyone earns, the more prizes will be unlocked!

    Each point you earn gives you a chance to win, but you'll need at least 300 points to qualify.

    Here's how you get points:

       - Rate a course you've taken (10 points)
       - Write reviews (50 points)
       - Share your review on Facebook (50 points)
       - Invite your friends to use Flow (100 points)

    Get started: www.uwflow.com

    Enjoy your last week of class,

    The Flow Team
