# Flow

Plan your courses

## Getting up and running

To set up your dev environment, run `make install`.

We work inside a [virtualenv][], so remember to `source
~/.virtualenv/rmc/bin/activate` whenever you're working within the repo.

You should now be ready to boot the local server, with `make local`.

Once it starts running, point your browser to http://localhost:5000/

### MongoDB error on Linux

If you are getting a connection refused error when trying to run `make local` and are on Linux, this is
most likely due to MongoDB taking too long to start the first time it's run. To fix this, run `mongod --config config/mongodb_local.conf`
and let it warm up for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Then kill the process, and run `make local` again. It should work now.


### Getting seed data

Run the following to get some basic course data into the DB.

```sh
make init_data
```

### Dependency issues on Linux

You may encounter errors regarding inheritance issues, invalid json conversions, or missing mock data while/after running `make install`, `make init_data`, or `make local`. If this is the case, you might have the wrong dependency versions installed or the installation didn't include certain dependencies in the first place. You can check by comparing `requirements.txt` with `pip freeze`. 

If they are different, replace the dependencies you currently have using:
```sh
pip freeze | xargs pip uninstall -y
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Why RMC?

It might seem funny that this repository and a bunch of the code references `rmc`.

RMC stands for "Rate My Courses", which was the prototype name for this project
before it was given the (slightly) better name of Flow.

Because of the profileration of this 3 letter prefix throughout the code, and the
unfortunate coupling of the repository name and our python namespace, we decided
to leave it be.

## Directory structure

If you're eager to dive into the code, you might want to read this first. This
isn't exhaustive, but it should be enough to get you started if you want to contribute.

- `config/`: Configuration for frameworks, databases, or anything that might vary between
            the development environment and production.
- `data/`: This is where we collect data and load it into the database
    - `crawler.py` downloads data by scraping pages and hitting APIs
    - `processor.py` processes the data grabbed by `crawler.py` and loads it into the DB
    - `aggregator.py` is run on a regular schedule (daily for the most part) to keep our data up to date
- `models/`: "Schema" definitions for our models backed by [MongoEngine][]
- `server/`: Request handlers, static assets, and templates
    - `templates/`: [Jinja2][] templates
        - Files in here ending with `_page.html` (e.g. `course_page.html`) are rendered directly by the
          [Flask][] server with `render_template` calls, with the exception of the `base_*_page.html`
          files which other `_page.html` templates inherit from.
        - Most of the other files (e.g. `course.html`) contain [Underscore templates][] used to render
          stuff on the client-side
    - `static`: Static assets eventually ending up as files served directly by [nginx][] when on production
        - `js`: All our JavaScript code, organized into [RequireJS][] modules
            - `ext/`: All third party JavaScript code
            - `main.js`: The entry point for JavaScript executing on page load
        - `sass`: We don't write CSS directly for Flow, we use the SCSS flavor of [Sass][], which compiles
                  down to CSS
    - `server.py`: The majority of the request handlers for the application, written in [Flask][]

## Using the REPL

If you need a REPL to fool around with the database or test out some code, check
out `tools/devshell.py`.

It automatically loads some imports and connects to the database for you. This
setup code can be found in `tools/devshell_eval.py`.

Here's what an example session might look like:

    $ tools/devshell.py
    Python 2.7.1 (r271:86832, Jul 31 2011, 19:30:53)
    Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

    IPython 0.13.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
    ?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
    %quickref -> Quick reference.
    help      -> Python's own help system.
    object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.

## Running tests

To run all the tests in the entire system:

```
make alltest
```

To run all the tests except the really slow ones (namely [Selenium][] tests):

```
make test
```

To run all the tests under a specific directory tree or in a specific file:
```
PYTHONPATH=.. nosetests server/api
PYTHONPATH=.. nosetests server/api/v1_test.py
```
